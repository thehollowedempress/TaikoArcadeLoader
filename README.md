# TaikoArcadeLoaderr

This is a loader for Taiko no Tatsujin Nijiiro ver.  
It currently supports the following versions:

* JPN 00.18
* JPN 08.18
* JPN 39.06
* CHN 00.32 (based on JPN 32.09)

**Attention**: As far as we know, the game can't run on graphic card equals or lower than GTX 7xx series(GTX 7xx is not supported either), so if the game crashes before it shows `avaliableRefreshRate`, that most likely means your graphic card is not supported!

## Setup

Copy the extracted contents of `dist.zip` to the same directory as Taiko.exe  
If your game hangs on a black screen at launch for more than a minute, Start Taiko.exe as Administrator.

## Building Manually

To compile TaikoArcadeLoader, you'll need to install [MSVC](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe).

Loading this project in CLion or VSCode with the cmake tools addon should then allow you to build the project.  
Do note that the .sln files created after you run the configure command CAN be opened using Visual Studio or Rider.  
If you want to build yourself, here are some instructions on how to do this from a cmd shell.  

Clone this repository, open *cmd* and run the following commands:

```bash
# Load the MSVC environment (Change this to your actual vcvarsall.bat path)
call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" x64

# Configure the build folder (this is only needed the first time)
cmake -B build -S . -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

# Build TaikoArcadeLoader
cmake --build build --config Release --target bnusio
```

The compiled dll of TaikoArcadeLoader will be created in the `dist` folder.
